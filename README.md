# About Me

Hi, my name is Amelia! I am an Algonquin college student who loves to code. I first got into coding several years ago. I loved working with HTML and CSS. Though it was challenging, there was always a sense of acomplishment and pride every time I was able to get a site to look exactly how I expected. Now, I am learning new languanges and expanding on those initial experiences.
